# Lab 02 — Interpret the CSV Reports

Open two CSVs (e.g., `fdaaa_timeliness_report.csv` and `harms_reporting_report.csv`).  
For each:
- Identify which rows are **flags** vs **passes**.
- Note at least one **data element** that is missing or inconsistent.
- Write 3–5 sentences on why that matters for patients or policy.
